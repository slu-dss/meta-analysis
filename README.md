## About the SLU DSS
### DSS Brownbag Series
This repository is associated with our semi-annual brownbag series, which we use to give SLU faculty, staff, and students the opportunity to showcase the awesome things they are doing with open-source tools (like `R`, Python, or Julia) in their research or teaching.
